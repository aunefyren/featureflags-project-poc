# Featureflags POC
This is a school project where I created a POC for testing featureflags for a potential customer. It has an admin panel which uses JS to communicate to a PHP API which saves the websites feature configuration as a JSON file, which then again is read by the website using the PHP API to configure how features are used. An admin can set features to on, off and shadow mode, changing the user experience. Read the included PDF to gain insight into the process and code. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
